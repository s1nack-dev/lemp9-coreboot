# lemp9-coreboot
Coreboot config for System76 Lemur aka LEMP9

Added coreboot.config file so I can attempt to use it to flash HEADS to my lemp9

The file was originally hosted here: https://gitlab.os-k.eu/os-k-team/coreboot-tianocore-for-clevo-based-laptops/-/blob/e2baafac0aa63f409a9f5cef249478c26ee895e7/models/lemp9/coreboot.config

The developers changed to repo and now I can no longer find it. Still on the hunt. I had to end up pulling the source code from the internet archives.
